As sea levels rise and ocean temperatures increase, dolphins are forced to adapt to changing conditions, and in some cases, populations are threatened or even in danger of extinction.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of climate change on dolphins is the disruption of their migration patterns. Dolphins rely on specific habitats for breeding, feeding, and resting. As these habitats become less hospitable due to changes in temperature, salinity, and other factors, dolphins must migrate to new areas to find suitable conditions.", 0.2733812949640288, 0.08759124087591241, 0.17266187050359713, 0.02453269015635402, 0.0, 2.0217391304347827], ["What threats do freshwater dolphins face?", "In addition to hunting and entanglement in fishing gear, freshwater dolphins face the additional threat of dams fragmenting and degrading habitat.", "Freshwater dolphins are threatened by habitat loss, pollution, dams, and overfishing.\n\nHow do freshwater dolphins find food?\n\nFreshwater dolphins use echolocation to find their prey. They emit clicks and listen for the echoes that bounce off objects. They can hear the echoes better than we can hear sounds, so they are able to detect the presence of fish, insects, and other prey even when it is hidden underwater.\n\nHow do freshwater dolphins defend themselves?\n\nFreshwater dolphins", 0.2061855670103093, 0.021052631578947368, 0.12371134020618556, 0.01208343398907959, 0.0, 3.619047619047619], ["Where can I learn more about dolphin intelligence?", "Dive into the science of dolphin cognition with researchers studying how these amazing creatures make sense of their world.

They are carnivorous animals that feed on fish, crustaceans, and squid. They are known for their playful behavior, intelligence, and ability to communicate with one another using complex vocalizations.\n\nDolphins are found in all oceans of the world, except the Arctic and Antarctic.
